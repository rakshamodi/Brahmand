          <h1>Uranus</h1>
        <p>Uranus is made of water, methane, and ammonia fluids above a small rocky center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen and helium like Jupiter and Saturn, but it also has methane. The methane makes Uranus blue.
        </p><p>Uranus also has faint rings. The inner rings are narrow and dark. The outer rings are brightly colored and easier to see. Like Venus, Uranus rotates in the opposite direction as most other planets. And unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates on its side.</p>
        <h4>Structure and Surface</h4>
        <p>Uranus is surrounded by a set of 13 rings.</p><p>
        Uranus is an ice giant (instead of a gas giant). It is mostly made of flowing icy materials above a solid core.
        </p><p>Jupiter has a very thick atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Uranus has a thick atmosphere made of methane, hydrogen, and helium.
        </p>
        <p>Uranus is the only planet that spins on its side.</p>
        <p>Uranus spins the opposite direction as Earth and most other planets.</p>
        <h4>Time on Uranus</h4>
        <p>One day on Uranus lasts a little over 17 hours (17 hours and 14 minutes, to be exact).</p><p>
        One year on Uranus is the same as 84 years on Earth. That’s a long time to wait for a birthday cake.
        </p>
        <h4>Uranus's Neighbors</h4>
        <p>Uranus has 27 known moons.</p><p>
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. That means Saturn and Neptune are Uranus’ neighboring planets.
