          <h1>Eros</h1>
          <p>Eros (minor planet designation: (433) Eros), provisional designation 1898 DQ, is a stony and asteroid of the Amor group and the first discovered and second-largest near-Earth object with an elongated shape and a mean diameter of approximately 16.8 kilometers. Visited by the NEAR Shoemaker space probe in 1998, it became the first asteroid ever studied from orbit around the asteroid.
          </p>
          <p>The asteroid was discovered by German astronomer C.G. Witt at the Berlin Observatory on 13 August 1898 in an eccentric orbit between Mars and Earth, and later named after Eros, a god from Greek mythology; the son of Aphrodite, who is identified with the planet Venus.
